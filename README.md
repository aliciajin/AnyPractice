Topic: 
Breast Cancer Prediction 

Data: 
683 observations with 10 features:
"Cl.thickness"    "Cell.size"       "Cell.shape"      "Marg.adhesion"   "Epith.c.size"    "Bare.nuclei"     "Bl.cromatin"     "Normal.nucleoli"  "Mitoses"         "Class" 

and two classification results: "benign"  "malignant"

The .R script shows the whole process of this model building:

1. Input data and randomly seperate data into dataset into 90% training set(615 obs.) and 10% testing set(68 obs.). 

2. Build the model in API using training data.

3. Perform prediction on testing data and estimate the model.



Thanks!
